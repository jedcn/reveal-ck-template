# A template project for using reveal-ck

This project contains all that's necessary for starting with
reveal-ck.

My suggestion is that you fork it, rename your fork to match your
talk, and then start commiting and pushing your latest slides to your
renamed fork.

## Getting Started

* Fork this repository
* Rename your newly forked repository
* Clone your fork
* Get reveal-ck by running a `bundle`
* Generate the set of slides that come with this template by running
  `reveal-ck generate`
* View the slides by running `open slides/index.html` (MacOS)

Once you've made it this far, start editing your `slides.haml` and run
`reveal-ck generate` as you make progress.

If you've already got the slides open in a browser, just refresh.

Remember to commit (and push) progress as you go.

Enjoy!
