# A template project for using reveal-ck

This project contains all that's necessary for starting with
reveal-ck.

My suggestion is that you:

* Fork it

* Rename your fork to match your talk

* Clone it

* Get reveal-ck by running a `bundle`

* Run `reveal-ck generate` which will build the set of slides that
  come with the project and ensure that everything is up and running.

* View the generate slides in a browser by running `open
  slides/index.html` (MacOS only)

* Update `config.toml` (supply your name, talk name, change theme if
  desired)

Once you've made it this far, start editing your `slides.haml` and
re-run `reveal-ck generate` as you make progress.

You can commit and push as you go.

Enjoy!
